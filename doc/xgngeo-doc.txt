1 Introduction
**************

This is the official documentation for *XGngeo*, a frontend (graphical
user interface) for *Gngeo*, a command line *Neo Geo* (arcade game
playing system made by SNK) emulator for the _GNU/Linux_ operating
system (and may be some other Unices) with high speed performance and
many configurable options. Both are free/libre softwares released under
the terms of the _GNU General Public License_.

   XGngeo is written in _Python_ and uses the _PyGTK_ library to
provide a complete, practical and user-friendly _GTK+_ interface! With
its multiple configuration panels, designed in an intuitive way,
emulator behaviour can be regulated both precisely and easily; while
Rom selection is made simple thanks to a full featured list with
preview image and various game information, etc.

   This program development is conducted by the *Choplair-network*
crew, the lastest version and information about XGngeo are available
from our website (see chapter 4 section 1.1). Although we are not
directly taking part in the Gngeo development (and are not the official
frontend too), we follow it closely and try to implement all its
functionalities in the most correct way possible, in accordance with
the author (Mathieu Peponas) who gently encourages interactions between
frontends and its emulator.

   This paper, which is supposed to grow up with each new XGngeo
release, provides a sort of _Newbie Guide_ to get started with easy Neo
Geo emulation combining these two programs, and also some details about
this frontend's features and its functioning.

2 Getting started
*****************

This is the complete procedure about how to get the dynamic combination
of Gngeo and XGngeo fully functional from scratch, step by step!

2.1 Prerequisites
=================

2.1.1 Emulator and Bios
-----------------------

XGngeo is a frontend for Gngeo, so this must be installed somewhere on
your computer! You can download the last version from its home page
(see chapter 4 section 1.1). Although the emulator is available in
various binary formats (deb, RPM...), keep in mind that these packages
may be older than the classic source code archive. For this release, we
do recommand the use of Gngeo version *0.6.4*. But consider that any
previous 0.6.x version should be fine for being used under XGngeo.

   Before installing Gngeo, you have to check for the some
dependencies: Gngeo graphical rendering is based over the *SDL*
(`Simple Directmedia Layer') library (version 1.2 or more), which is
thus required, with *OpenGL* headers for its OpenGL blitter. It also
needs *zlib* to extract Rom zip archives. Optionally, you may install
the *NASM* package (version 0.98 or more) in order to provide assembler
optimisations. Their home page address, for informational purposes, are
given on chapter 4 section 1.

   Once this is okay, you can install Gngeo, corresponding to the
format it was grabed into. If, for some reasons, the installation does
not work, you may ask for help from the Gngeo mailling list (chapter 4
section 2).

   To be able to launch Roms, Gngeo will need a Neo Geo Bios. It is an
archive which consists of the following files: `neo-geo.rom',
`ng-sfix.rom' and `ng-lo.rom'. They have to be put into the same
directory as your Roms (the so called `Rom and Bios directory'!).

2.1.2 Other requirements
------------------------

Especially for XGngeo, you also need the following softwares to be
installed:

   - The *Python* programming language: version 2.2 or more.

   - The *Gimp Tool Kit* aka GTK+: version 2.6 or more.

   - The *PyGTK* library: version 2.6 or more.

   That's perhaps already the case. Otherwise, you'll find the links to
their home page on chapter 4 section 1.2.

2.2 Getting and launching XGngeo
================================

It's show time! Your are now ready to taste the power of XGngeo. ^^

   If you didn't obtain this documentation as a part of an XGngeo
package, you have to get one! You'll find download links for the last
version on the Choplair-network homepage (see chapter 4 section 1.1).
Thereafter, unpack the archive, then move to the directory which have
just been created (something like `xgngeo-_XX_' where _XX_ is the
version number).

   *At this time, we _do_ assume that you have installed everything
indicated above.* Since Python code is interpreted, XGngeo doesn't
require any compilation phase. To launch it, simply enter: `python
xgngeo.py'. If you get an error doing so, please refer to the chapter 4
section 2.

2.3 First time important path configuration
===========================================

At the beggining, XGngeo should invite you to set up some important
parameters that are required to build up basic configuration files with
three important options required for a working emulation. The first
one, the path to your Rom driver file (`romrc'), is set with the
default value, like the path to the Gngeo executable. Actually, you
would just have to tell the directory where are located your Neo Geo
Roms and Bios.

   Once you have finished, press SAVE. Of course, these parameters can
be modified at any time thereafter, using the same configuration window.

   If for some reason you want to skip this important path check at
boot time, it is possible by just giving `--nobootcheck' as a command
line parameter. But this is definitely *not* recommanded!

2.4 Main window
===============

Unless you obtained a warning dialog because some parameters looked
invalid, the XGngeo main window should appear...

2.4.1 Status bar
----------------

First, you might be pleased by the welcome message at bottom of the
main window. However, the message in this status bar may change and
provide some information which is not so useless for the user. For
example, it confirms that configuration has been saved or not, and also
indicate which Rom you have selected, and it's status
(stopped/running). In one word: marvellous!

2.4.2 Menu bar
--------------

Of course, you may fall in love with the great logo, but actually your
attention should go to the menu bar, on the upper part, which you'll be
able to control everything with!

   It is primarily composed of the FILE menu, which permits you do
simple operations such as loading Rom, starting or stopping it, and
exiting the program.

   Next to that is, comes the CONFIGURATION menu, from where you can
modify the paramaters which you entered at the XGngeo first load and
also some other little options, mostly related to XGngeo's own
behaviour. But the most interesting thing here is the GLOBAL EMULATION
sub-menu which allows you to set the default Gngeo emulation
configuration (graphic, audio, keys, etc.) for every game (but it is
also possible to set specific game configuration). These emulation
configuration panels are detailed in the section 2 of the next chapter.

   At last, on the very right-hand, from the INFO menu you can look at
the credits or read again and again the holy GNU General Public Licence
whom XGngeo is released under!

2.5 Playing a game
==================

Okay, you can set emulation options as you want, then it's time to
launch a game! There are 3 ways to select a Rom for playing : through
the Rom list, a file chooser, or the recent Rom history. The file
chooser is useful only if the Rom you want to load is located in
another place than the `Rom and Bios directory', and the recent Rom
history is just a menu providing quick selection for some Roms you have
previously chosen.

   Actually, you would probably use the Rom list window which allows
you to see all the Roms available in your `Rom and Bios directory', in
a clean way, and select one from those. From there, you can also set
specific emulation configuration for any Rom, and even see game preview
or information (see chapter 3 section 2.1)

   Once you have selected a Rom, it should be launched by Gngeo and
playable only a few seconds later! `The future is now', enjoy the Neo
Geo! :-D

   While playing, you still can perform some special actions in the
emulator, like toggling beetween fullscreen/windowed mode,
saving/loading state, etc. (see chapter 3 section 3). By the way, you
can also disable the auto Rom execution feature (if you prefer to do so
manually) in the OTHER THINGS configuration window.

3 Details
*********

3.1 Used files
==============

3.1.1 Main configuration files
------------------------------

XGngeo's configuration interface actually manages options of 2 main
configuration files at the same time. Both using the same syntax, which
is just lines of a variable name followed, after a space, by its
corresponding value. :p

3.1.1.1 `gngeorc'
.................

This is the Gngeo's global configuration file, situated in the
`~/gngeo/' directory. It lets you customize many params of the
emulator, some of which are highly important (path to the `romrc' file,
etc.), which will be the default for any Rom.

3.1.1.2 `xgngeo.conf'
.....................

This is the XGngeo's own configuration file, situated in the `data/'
directory which is in the XGngeo's. This second file is less important,
there are only options related to XGngeo (size of history, preview
images' directory, etc.).  That's why most of these options are
modifiable in the OTHER THINGS section.

3.1.2 Rom-specific configuration files
--------------------------------------

Since its version 0.6, Gngeo is able to perform emulation in a specific
way for each Rom.

   That's quite simple: before loading the Rom, the emulator looks for
a file, in the `~/gngeo/' directory, which is named in the form of
`_mame_name_.cf' (where _mame_name_ is the Mame name of the game). If
it does exist, the emulation parameters from are taken from, without
taking care of the ones set in the `gngeorc', which is used otherwise.
The syntax for these files is still the same.

   Rom-specific configuration files can be easily handled through
XGngeo, as detailed in the next section...

3.1.3 Rom driver file
---------------------

The Rom driver file (named `romrc') is very important as it contains
all the instructions for the emulator to correctly handle the Roms. All
technical specifications required for them to work are all put together
in that (very big!) Rom driver file.

3.1.4 History file
------------------

This simple ASCII file (`~/.gngeo/history') contains, in descending
order, lines of the full name (between double quotes) and the absolute
path of recently loaded Roms, in order to be displayed in the HISTORY
menu of XGngeo. Note that although it is placed in the Gngeo user
directory, this file was created for XGngeo and is thus not directly
updated by the emulator but by the frontend.

3.2 Particular windows
======================

3.2.1 Rom list add-ons
----------------------

There are also optional features (add-on) which bring you a more
comfortable game selection in the Rom list window. Here they are...

3.2.1.1 Preview images
......................

XGngeo is able to display a preview image of any of the games selected
in the list.  It is fully compatible with the preview images used by
other frontends such as *GGF* (`GnGeo Frontend'), which implemented it
formerly.

   Thus, a preview image pack archive can be easily obtained from the
Gngeo, GGF or Choplair-network home page.  You will need to unpack them
somewhere, then to indicate the directory where they are located in the
OTHER THING CONFIGURATION window, in order to get it working instantly!

3.2.1.2 Rom information
.......................

GGF's developpers created an XML file containing information
(description, manufacturer, year, etc.) about loads of Roms in order to
be displayed by frontends. This is the perfect addition to preview
images and it's fully supported by XGngeo!  Moreover, because of the
small size of this file, it is already included in our packages and
this add-on is activated by default.

   *Note:* the game reviews are not ours, but have been performed by
the _Ultimate Neo Gaming Ressource_ (UNGR). You can read them online
and find other interesting things on their homepage (see chapter 4
section 1.3).

3.2.2 Emulation configuration panels
------------------------------------

The options which can be set in global or the rom-specific emulation
configuration window are exactly the same. As XGngeo provides graphical
management for a lot of Gngeo parameters, they have been divided in
serveral panels according to which emulation domain they are dealing
with, for the sake of clarity.

3.2.2.1 Graphic panel
.....................

You can activate many options here: fullscreen mode, frame skipping
(real-time speed), interpolation (smoother animation), etc.  Moreover,
you may select your prefered blitter (software, OpenGL, YUV) and choose
to apply an effect upon it (scanline, HQX, etc.).

   Please note that effects are currently not supported by the YUV
blitter of Gngeo. Thus, the effect list becomes disabled in XGngeo when
you select this blitter.

3.2.2.2 Sound / Joystick panel
..............................

There are few options for sound and joystick, which is why they are
regrouped in one panel. You may set support for them and, if enabled,
specify some options (sound sample rate, joystick devices).

3.2.2.3 Keyboard panel
......................

This panel is a *keyboard* (not joystick! :p) control configurator
which permits you to easily customize the 2 player controls. To modify
a key, just click on the corresponding button then push your new key.

   *Warning:* since Gngeo (SDL's) and XGngeo (GTK's) keymaps are
different, some special keys might be not recognized by XGngeo. If it
occurs, please tell us (refer to the chapter 2 section 2)!

3.2.2.4 System panel
....................

Here you can set some Neo Geo core preference. You can change the
region (Japan, USA, Europe), which often modifies the game language,
and also the Neo Geo type: _arcade_ (classic mode with credit given by
coins) or _console_ (usually more complete and permiting configuration
through an option menu).

3.3 Special actions in Gngeo
============================

Using function keys, you can perform some special actions while playing
a Rom in Gngeo.  Here comes the list of what you can do by pressing
these keys:

   - <Escape>: exit game.

   - <F1>: reset game.

   - <F2>: take a screeshot (BMP file saved in your home directory).

   - <F3>: enter Neo Geo Bios configuration interface.

   - <F4>: enable/disable display of pressed key value.

   - <F5>: enable/disable display of FPS value.

   - <F6>: enable/disable slow motion.

   - <F8>: save current game state (to a slot you thereafter specify,
     from the one hundred possible!).

   - <F9>: load a saved game state (from a slot you thereafter specify).

   - <F10>: enable/disable auto frame skip.

   - <F11>: enable/disable sleep mode when Gngeo is idle.

   - <F12>: enable/disable fullscreen mode.

3.4 Internationalization
========================

XGngeo is multilingual! Translations are currently available in the
following languages:

   - English (default)

   - French

   - Polish*

   - Portuguese of Brazil

   - Spanish

   *Note:* a language followed by an asterisk means that its
translation is unfortunately not up-to-date with the current release
original strings. Don't hesitate to update it! You can even make a new
translation, just look bellow...

3.4.1 Making a new translation
------------------------------

If you want to create a new translation of XGngeo into your language,
follow these generic instructions:

  1. Get the current XGngeo developement version from its CVS by doing
     the following command (on a single line):
     `cvs -z3
     -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xgngeo.berlios.de:/cvsroot/xgngeo
     checkout xgngeo'

  2. Go to the `lang/' directory which is in `xgngeo/data/'.

  3. Create a directory named like your language code (usually the one
     returned by `echo $LANG').  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/
     gettext_15.html#SEC221' for an exhaustive list.

  4. Into this one, create a new directory named `LC_MESSAGES'.

  5. Go back to the `lang/' directory then open the translation
     template `xgngeo.pot' with your favorite translation tool (KBabel,
     GTranslator, Poedit, etc.).

  6. Once you've finished translating. Save it as
     `_XX_/LC_MESSAGES/xgngeo.po' (where _XX_ is your language code).

  7. Go to `_XX_/LC_MESSAGES/' then do: `msgfmt xgngeo.po -o
     xgngeo.mo'. This will create a binary file (`xgngeo.mo') readable
     by the program.

  8. Launch XGngeo, which is now translated in your language!

   Every time you update your translation, don't forget to repeat step
number 7. When you feel it's perfect, you may send your `po' file to
<chopinou[AT]choplair.org>.
