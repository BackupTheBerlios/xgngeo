Introduction
************

*XGngeo* is a frontend (GUI) for *Gngeo* which is a Neo Geo emulator
for GNU/Linux. Both are free software released under the _GNU GPL
license_.  XGngeo is written in Python and uses the PyGTK library to
provide a user-friendly interface!
XGngeo is developed by the *Choplair-network*, lastest
version/information should be available on our website:
`http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/'.

   This documentation provides up to date informations and a _Newbies
Guide_ about how to get started with XGngeo. It will grow (I hope...)
with each new version.

Get started
***********

This is the complete procedure about how to get XGngeo fully functional
from scratch!

Gngeo
=====

XGngeo is a frontend for Gngeo, so you need this one!
Download the last stable Gngeo package from
`http://m.peponas.free.fr/gngeo/'.  Unpack it, configure, then start
compilation... If the compilation fails, take a look at the "Help"
chapter. Otherwise, you may now install it...

Other requirements
==================

In order to get XGngeo running, you need the following software
installed on your computer:

   * The *Python* programming language (version 2.2 or more) -
     `http://www.python.org/';

   * The *PyGTK* library (version 1.99 or more) -
     `http://www.daa.com.au/~james/software/pygtk/'.

Neo Geo bios
============

To be able to launch roms, Gngeo needs a Neo Geo bios which have to be
put (as unpackted format) in your Rom's directory.

Run XGngeo
==========

It's time! Your are now ready to taste XGngeo. ^^
Download the last XGngeo package from the Choplair-network homepage:
`http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/'.
Unpack it then enter in the `xgngeo-_XX_' directory (where _XX_ is
XGngeo's version number).  XGngeo doesn't need any compilation phase.
To launch it, simply type: `python xgngeo.py'.  If you get an error
doing that, please see the "Help" chapter.

Configuration
=============

Because it's the first time you are using Gngeo, XGngeo invites you to
set up the configuration.  Press OK then the configuration window
appears... You can let default values if you are in a rush, the only
params that you must define are PATH TO ROMRC and ROMS AND BIOS
DIRECTORY. Once you have finished, press SAVE.
Of course the configuration can be modified at any time using the same
configuration window.

Focus on...
***********

Configuration files
===================

XGngeo's configuration interface actually manages options of 2
configuration files in the same time. Both use the same syntax to set
values at variables.

`gngeorc'
---------

This is the Gngeo's configuration file, situated in the `~/gngeo/'
directory. It lets you customize many params of the emulator (graphic,
sound, etc.), some are very important (path to the `romrc' file, etc.).
If at startup XGngeo doesn't find the `gngeorc' file, it invites you to
create it through its main configuration window.

`xgngeo.conf'
-------------

This is the XGngeo's own configuration file, situated in the `data/'
directory which is in the XGngeo's. This second file is less important,
there are only options related to XGngeo (size of history, preview
images' directory, etc.).  That's why most of these options are in the
OTHER section of the main configuration window.

Rom list add-ons
================

These are optional features which give you a comfortable selection
while selecting any game in the Rom list. They can be configured in the
OTHER section of the main configuration window.

Preview images
--------------

XGngeo is able to display a preview image of any of the games selected
in the list.
It is fully compatible with the preview images used by other frontends
such _GGF_.
A preview images pack archive, which will have to be unpacked
somewhere, can be easily obtained from Gngeo's or Choplair-network's
homepage...

Rom infos
---------

_GGF_'s developpers have created an XML file containing information for
each Rom (description, manufacturer, year, etc.).
This is the perfect addition to preview images and it's fully supported
by XGngeo!

Keys configuration
==================

XGngeo has a Keys configurator which is in a seperate window than the
main configuration window. It works for the 2 players, but only with
keyboard.  To modify a key, click on the corresponding button then push
your new key.

   *Warning:* Because Gngeo (_SDL_'s) and XGngeo (_GTK_'s) keymaps are
different, some special keys might be not recognized by XGngeo. If it
occurs, please tell us (see the "Help" chapter)!

Internationalization
====================

XGngeo is multilingual! Translations are available in these languages:

   * english (default)

   * french

   * polish

   * portuguese

   * spanish

New translation
---------------

If you want to make a translation of XGngeo in your language, follow
these generic instructions:

  1. Get the lastest CVS version by doing the following:
        * `cvs
          -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xgngeo.berlios.de:/cvsroot/xgngeo
          login' (press RETURN)

        * `cvs -z3
          -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xgngeo.berlios.de:/cvsroot/xgngeo
          checkout xgngeo'

  2. Go to the `data/lang/' directory.

  3. Create a directory named as your language's code (returned with:
     `echo $LANG'). See
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_15.html#SEC221'
     for a exhaustive list.

  4. Into the last one, create a new directory named `LC_MESSAGES'.

  5. Go back to `data/lang/' then open the translation template
     `xgngeo.pot' with your favorite translation tool (KBabel,
     GTranslator, etc.).

  6. Once you've finished translating. Save it as
     `_XX_/LC_MESSAGES/xgngeo.po' (where _XX_ is your language's code).

  7. Go to `_XX_/LC_MESSAGES/' then do: `msgfmt xgngeo.po -o
     xgngeo.mo'. This will create a ".mo" file readable by the program.

  8. Launch XGngeo which is now translated in your language!

   Every time you update your translation, don't forget to repeat step
7. When it's Ok, send your ".po" file to: <choplair[AT]fr.st>.

Help
****

If you get any problems using XGngeo or Gngeo, the best way is to ask
for help in the Gngeo's mailling list:

   * *Suscribtion:* send a blank email to <gngeo-request[AT]ml.free.fr>
     with the subject *subscribe*.

   * *Posting:* send your messages to <gngeo[AT]ml.free.fr>.
