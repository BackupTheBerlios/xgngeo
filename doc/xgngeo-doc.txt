1 Introduction
**************

 This is the official documentation for *XGngeo*, a frontend (graphical
user interface) for *GnGeo*, which a command line *Neo Geo* (arcade
game playing system made by SNK) emulator for the _GNU/Linux_ and
_FreeBSD_ operating systems (and may be some other Unices) with high
speed performance and many configurable options. On top of all, both
are free/libre softwares released under the terms of the _GNU General
Public License_.

   XGngeo is written in _Python_ and uses the _PyGTK_ library to
provide a practical and user-friendly _GTK+_ interface over GnGeo! With
its multiple configuration panels, designed in an intuitive way,
emulator behaviour can be regulated both precisely and easily; while
ROM selection is made simple thanks to a full featured list with
preview image and various game information, etc.

   This program development is conducted by the *Choplair-network*
crew, the lastest version and informations about XGngeo are available
from our website (see chapter 4 section 1.1). Although we are not
directly taking part in the GnGeo development (and there is not
official frontend too), we follow it closely and try to implement all
its functionalities in the most correct way possible, in accordance
with the author (Mathieu Peponas) who gently encourages interactions
between frontends and its emulator.

   This paper, which is supposed to grow up and keep up-to-date with
each new XGngeo release, provides a sort of _Newbie Guide_ to get
started with easy Neo Geo emulation combining these two programs, and
also some details about this frontend or GnGeo's features and their
functioning.

2 Getting started
*****************

This is the complete procedure about how to get the dynamic combination
of GnGeo and XGngeo fully functional on your system, from scratch, step
by step!

2.1 Prerequisites
=================

2.1.1 Emulator and Bios
-----------------------

XGngeo is a frontend for GnGeo, so this one must be installed somewhere
on your computer! You can download the last version from its home page
(see chapter 4 section 1). Although the emulator is available in
various binary formats (deb, RPM...), keep in mind that these packages
may be older than the classic source code archive.

   As of XGngeo version 16, the minimum version of GnGeo we ask you to
use is the *0.6.11*. Trying to launch the frontend with an older
version of the emulator will make XGngeo refusing to start untill you
indicated where to find a supported version of GnGeo on your computer.

   Before installing GnGeo, you have to check for the some dependencies:
   - GnGeo graphical rendering is based over the *SDL* (`Simple
     Directmedia Layer') library (version 1.2 or more), which is thus
     required, with *OpenGL* headers for its OpenGL blitter.

   - It also needs *zlib* to extract ROM zip archives.

   - Optionaly, you may install the *NASM* package (version 0.98 or
     more) in order to provide assembler optimisations.
   Their home page adress, for information purpose, are given on
chapter 4 section 1.

   Once this is okay, you can install GnGeo, corresponding to the
format it was grabed into. If, for some reasons, the installation does
not work, you may ask for help from the GnGeo mailling list (chapter 4
section 2).

   To be able to launch ROMs, GnGeo will need a Neo Geo BIOS. It is an
archive which consists of the following files: `neo-geo.rom',
`ng-sfix.rom' and `ng-lo.rom'. They have to be put (decompressed) into
the same directory as your Roms (the so called `ROM and Bios
directory'!).

2.1.2 Other requirements
------------------------

Especially for XGngeo, you also need the following softwares to be
installed:

   - The *Python* programming language: version 2.2 or more.

   - The *Gimp Tool Kit* aka GTK+: version 2.6 or more.

   - The *PyGTK* library: version 2.6 or more.

   That's perhaps already the case. Otherwise, you'll find the links to
their home page on chapter 4 section 1.2.

2.2 Getting and launching XGngeo
================================

It's show time! Your are now ready to taste the power of XGngeo. ^^

   Here is the installation procedure for the source code archive.
You'll have to process differently if you choosed to use a specific
package for your distribution. In a such case, check its documentation
for details, then pass directly to the next section if installation
succeeded.

   If you didn't obtain this documentation as a part of a XGngeo
package, you have to get one! You'll find download links for the last
version on the Choplair-network homepage (see chapter 4 section 1.1).

   Thereafter, unpack the archive, then move to the directory which
have just been created (something like `xgngeo-_XX_' where _XX_ is the
version number).

   *At this time, we _do_ assume that you have installed everything
indicated above.*

   Since Python code is interpreted, XGngeo doesn't require any
compilation phase. T You just have to install the files on your
computer by entering, _as root_: `python setup.py install'.

   After the installation process quickly ended up, you may just, _as a
normal user_ now, type the `xgngeo' command to launch the frontend. If
you get an error doing so, please refer to the chapter 4 section 2.
Otherwise, you are entering the serious things! :)

2.3 First time important path configuration
===========================================

At the beggining, XGngeo should invite you to set up some important
parameters that are required to build up basic configuration files with
three important options required for a working emulation. The first
one, the path to your ROM driver file (`romrc'), is set with the
default value, like the path to the GnGeo executable. Actually, you
would have just to tell the directory where are located your Neo Geo
ROMs and BIOS.

   Once you have finished, press SAVE. Of course, these parameters can
be modified at any time thereafter, using the same configuration window.

   If for some reason you want to pass out this important path check at
boot time, it is possible by just giving `--nobootcheck' as a command
line parameter. But this is definitively *not* recommanded!

2.4 Main window
===============

Unless you obtained a warning dialog because some parameters looked
invalid, the XGngeo main window should appear...

2.4.1 Status bar
----------------

First, you might be pleased by the welcome message at bottom of the
main window. However, the message in this status bar may change and
provide some information which is not so useless for the user. For
example, it confirms that configuration has been saved or not, and also
indicate which ROM you have selected, and it's status
(stopped/running). In one word: marvellous!

2.4.2 Menu bar
--------------

Of course, you may fall in love with the great XGngeo logo, but
actually your attention should go to the menu bar, on the upper part,
which you'll be able to control everything with!

   It is primarily composed of the FILE  menu, which permits you do
simple operations such as loading ROM, starting or stopping it, and
exiting the program.

   Next to that is, comes the CONFIGURATION menu, from where you can
modify the paramaters which you entered at the XGngeo first load and
also some other little options, mostly related to XGngeo's own
behaviour. But the most interesting thing here is the GLOBAL EMULATION
sub-menu which allows you to set the default GnGeo emulation
configuration (graphic, audio, keys, etc.) for every game (but it is
also possible to set specific game configuration). These emulation
configuration panels are detailed in the section 2 of the next chapter.

   At last, on the very right-hand, from the INFO menu you can look at
the credits or read (again and again) the holy GNU General Public
Licence which XGngeo is released under!

2.5 Playing a game
==================

Okay, you can set emulation options as you want, then it's time to
launch a game!
There are 3 different ways to load a ROM for being executed...

2.5.1 Through the ROM list window
---------------------------------

Actually, you would generaly use the ROM list window which brings you
an overall view of all the ROMs available in your `ROM and Bios
directory' (plus any other dictory you mentioned), and select one from
those. From there, you can also set specific emulation configuration
for any ROM, and even see game preview and/or information (see chapter
3 section 2.1)

2.5.2 Through the file chooser
------------------------------

The file chooser, as its name lets understand, is a classic GTK file
seclection window that allow you to load a ROM manually, from any place
in your file system. This method is useful if the ROM you want to load
is located in another place than in directories specified in the ROM
list window.

   If preview images were enabled, a ROM preview would be displayed, in
addition to its name, each time you would click on a file that appears
to be a valid ROM archive, detected by GnGeo.

2.5.3 Through the recent ROM history menu
-----------------------------------------

The recent ROM history is no more than a simple menu providing quick
loading function for the last ROMs you have previously chosen. Note
that you can remove a ROM from that list by right clicking over its
name.



   Once you have selected a ROM, it should be launched by GnGeo and
playable only a few seconds later! `The future is now', enjoy the Neo
Geo! :-D
While playing, you still can perform some special actions in the
emulator, like toggling beetween fullscreen/windowed mode,
saving/loading state, etc. (see chapter 3 section 3). By the way, you
can also disable the auto ROM execution feature (if you prefer to do so
manually) in the OTHER THINGS configuration window.

3 Details
*********

3.1 Used configuration files
============================

3.1.1 Main configuration files
------------------------------

XGngeo's configuration interface actually manages options of 2 main
configuration files at the same time. Both using the same syntax, which
is just lines of a variable name followed, after a space, by its
corresponding value. :p

3.1.1.1 `gngeorc'
.................

This is the GnGeo's global configuration file, situated in the
`~/gngeo/' directory. It lets you customize many params of the emulator
which will be the default for any ROM. Some of these param are highly
important: path to the `romrc' file, `Main ROM and BIOS dictory', etc.

3.1.1.2 `xgngeo.conf'
.....................

This is the XGngeo's own configuration file, situated in the XGngeo's
user directory (`~/.xgngeo'). This second file may be considered as
less important since there are only options related to XGngeo (size of
history, path to preview images' directory, etc.). That's why most of
these options are modifiable in the OTHER THINGS section.

3.1.2 ROM-specific configuration files
--------------------------------------

Since its version 0.6, GnGeo is able to perform emulation in a specific
way for each ROM.

   That's quite simple: before loading the ROM, the emulator looks for
a file, in the `~/gngeo/' directory, which is named in the form of
`_mame_name_.cf' (where _mame_name_ is the Mame name of the game). If
it does exist, the emulation parameters from are taken from, without
taking care of the ones set in the `gngeorc', which is used otherwise.
The syntax for these files is still the same.

   ROM-specific configuration files can be easily handled through
XGngeo, as detailed in the next section...

3.1.3 ROM drivers
-----------------

ROM drivers are actualy defined a single driver file, named `romrc'.
This ASCII file is very important as it contains all the instructions
for the emulator to correctly handle all the ROMs.

   A more convenient to let the user add/modify/delete ROM drivers to
GnGeo than editing this very large file (presently more than 12.000
lines long!), would be to split all drivers into several ROM-specific
driver files that would be put in a `romrc.d' directory. This is hoped
to soon become the default in GnGeo, since it would among others really
facilitate a `ROM drivers editing interface' to be implemented in
future XGngeo version...

3.1.4 History file
------------------

This simple ASCII file (`~/.xgngeo/history') contains, in a descending
order, lines of the full name (between double quotes) and the absolute
path of recently loaded Roms, in order to be displayed in the HISTORY
menu of XGngeo. Placed in the XGngeo user directory, this file is thus
created and updated by the frontend and not the emulator.

3.2 Particular windows
======================

3.2.1 ROM list
--------------

There are also optional features (add-on) which bring you a more
comfortable game selection in the ROM list window. Here they are...

3.2.1.1 Preview images (add-on)
...............................

XGngeo is able to display a preview image of any of the games selected
in the list.  It is fully compatible with the preview images used by
other frontends such as *GGF* (`GnGeo Frontend'), which implemented it
formerly.

   Thus, a preview image pack archive can be easily obtained from the
GnGeo, GGF or Choplair-network home page.  You will need to unpack them
somewhere, then to indicate the directory where they are located in the
OTHER THING CONFIGURATION window, in order to get it working instantly!

3.2.1.2 ROM information
.......................

GGF's developpers created an XML file containing informations for each
ROM (description, manufacturer, year, etc.) about loads of Roms in
order to be displayed by frontends. This is the perfect addition to
preview images and it's fully supported by XGngeo!
Moreover, because of the small size of this file, it is already
included in our packages and this add-on is activated by default.

   *Note:* the game reviews are not ours, but have been performed by
the `Ultimate Neo Gaming Ressource' (UNGR). You can read them online
and find other interesting things on their homepage (see chapter 4
section 1.3).

3.2.2 Emulation configuration panels
------------------------------------

The options which can be set in global or the ROM-specific emulation
configuration window are exactly the same. As XGngeo provides graphical
management for a lot of GnGeo parameters, they have been divided in
serveral panels according to which emulation domain they are dealing
with, for the sake of clarity.

3.2.2.1 Display panel
.....................

You can activate many options here: fullscreen mode, frame skipping
(real-time speed), interpolation (smoother animation), etc. Moreover,
you may select your prefered blitter (software, OpenGL, YUV) and choose
to apply an effect upon it (scanline, HQX, etc.).

   Please note that effects are currently not supported by the YUV
blitter of GnGeo. Thus, the effect list becomes disabled in XGngeo when
you select this blitter.

3.2.2.2 Sound / Joystick panel
..............................

There are few options for sound and joystick, which is why they are
regrouped in one panel. You may set support for them and, if enabled,
specify some options (sound sample rate, joystick devices).

3.2.2.3 Controls panel
......................

In the Neo Geo, we can observe 4 kinds of key: the _directional
arrows_, the _fire buttons_ (A, B, C & D), the _Start/Coin_, and the
_hot keys_.

   XGngeo has a keyboard configurator which permits you to easily
customize all the 2 player controls. To modify a key, just click on the
corresponding button then push your new key.

   *Warning:* since GnGeo (SDL's) and XGngeo (GTK's) keymaps are
different, some special keys might be not recognized by XGngeo. If it
occurs, please tell us (refer to the chapter 2 section 2)!

   Please give some attention to the four *hot keys*: they are optional
and allow you to actually binds one key to a combination of multiple
fire buttons (ie. to perform special game actions in a easier way).
Those combinations are freely configurable, independently for the 2
players.

3.2.2.4 System panel
....................

Here you can set some Neo Geo core preference. You can change the
region (Japan, USA, Europe), which often modifies the game language,
and also the Neo Geo BIOS type: _arcade_ (classic mode with credit
given by coins), _console_ (usually more complete and permiting
configuration through an option menu) or _universe_ (a mix of both!).

3.2.3 Special actions in GnGeo
------------------------------

Using function keys, you can perform some special actions while playing
a ROM in GnGeo. Here comes the list of what you can do by pressing
these keys:

   - <Escape>: exit game.

   - <F1>: reset game.

   - <F2>: take a screeshot (BMP file saved in your home directory).

   - <F3>: enter Neo Geo Bios configuration interface.

   - <F4>: enable/disable display of pressed key value.

   - <F5>: enable/disable display of FPS value.

   - <F6>: enable/disable slow motion.

   - <F8>: save current game state (to a slot you thereafter specify,
     from the one hundred possible!).

   - <F9>: load a saved game state (from a slot you thereafter specify).

   - <F10>: enable/disable auto frame skip.

   - <F11>: enable/disable sleep mode when GnGeo is idle.

   - <F12>: enable/disable fullscreen mode.

3.3 Internationalization
========================

XGngeo is multilingual! Translations are currently available in the
following languages:

   - English (default)

   - French

   - German

   - Polish*

   - Portuguese of Brazil

   - Spanish

   *Note:* the translations of a language followed by an asterisk, are,
unfortunately, not up-to-date with the current release original
strings. Don't hesitate to update them! You can even make new
translation, just look below...

3.3.1 Making new translation
----------------------------

If you want to perform a new translation of XGngeo into your language,
please follow the last instructions that you'll find mentionned on the
Choplair-network's website (see address below).

4.2 GnGeo mailling list
=======================

If you get any problem using GnGeo, directly or through a frontend such
as XGngeo, the best way is certainly to ask for help on the official
GnGeo mailling list, where you should get quick and effective answers
from its little community, including XGngeo developers.
Here is how to:

   - *Suscribe:* send a blank email, with the word `subscribe' as a
     subject, to <gngeo-request[AT]ml.free.fr>. Note that prior
     subscribtion is mandatory to post any new message.

   - *Post:* send your messages to <gngeo[AT]ml.free.fr>.

   By the way, list archives are available on the web at the following
address: `http://www.mail-archive.com/gngeo@ml.free.fr/'. You would
have better to check out that your problem hasn't been already
discussed and solved before posting a new help message.
