Introduction
************

*XGngeo* is a frontend (GUI) for the Neo Geo emulator *Gngeo*, both are
free softwares released under the _GNU GPL license_.  XGngeo is written
in Python and uses the PyGTK library for its interface.
XGngeo is developed by the *Choplair-network*, latest version is
available on its website: `http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/'.
This documentation provides some information and a _Newbies Guide_
about get started with XGngeo. It will grow (I hope...) with each new
version.

Get started
***********

This is the complete and detailed procedure about how to get XGngeo
fully functional!

Gngeo
=====

XGngeo is a frontend for Gngeo, so you need this one!
Download the last Gngeo package from `http://m.peponas.free.fr/gngeo/'.
Unpack it, configure, then start compilation... If the compilation
fails, take a look at the "Help" chapter. Otherwise, you may now
install it...

Other requirements
==================

In order to get XGngeo running, you need the following software
installed on your computer:

   * The *Python* programming language (version 2.2 or more) -
     `http://www.python.org/';

   * The *PyGTK* library (version 1.99 or more) -
     `http://www.daa.com.au/~james/software/pygtk/'.

Neo Geo bios
============

To be able to launch roms, Gngeo needs a Neo Geo bios.

Run XGngeo
==========

It's time! Your are now ready to taste XGngeo. ^^
Download the last XGngeo package from the Choplair-network homepage:
`http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/'.
Unpack it then enter in the `xgngeo-_XX_' directory (where _XX_ is
XGngeo's version number).  XGngeo doesn't need any compilation phase.
To launch it, simply type: `python xgngeo.py'.  If you get an error
doing that, please see the "Help" chapter.

Configuration (`gngeorc')
=========================

Because it's the first time you'll use Gngeo, you will need to create
the Gngeo configuration file (`~/.gngeo/gngeorc').
With XGngeo, it's quite easy: you are invited to configure Gngeo, press
OK then the configuration window will appear...  You must set paths:

   * The _Roms & Bios directory_ is where both your Roms and the Neo
     Geo bios are.

   * The `romrc' file is a list of data required by Gngeo to play Roms.
     Its default location is `/usr/local/share/gngeo/romrc'.

   * The `libGL.so' file is required for OpenGL. Its location changes
     depending of the distribution; but it's usually
     `/usr/lib/libGL.so' or `/usr/local/lib/libGL.so'.

   Once you have finished, press SAVE.
Of course the configuration can be modified at any time using the same
configuration window...

Features
********

Preview images (optional)
=========================

Since version 9, XGngeo is able to display preview images while
selecting any of the games in the list.
It is fully compatible with the preview images used by other Gngeo's
frontends such _GGF_.
To enable the preview images, simply unpack the images pack archive
(that you may get from Gngeo's homepage or somewhere in the
Choplair-network...) into the XGngeo's directory.

Keys configuration
==================

Since version 12, XGngeo got a Key Configurator. It works for the 2
players, but only with keyboard.  To modify a key, click on the
corresponding button then push your new key.
*Warning:* Because Gngeo (_SDL_'s) and XGngeo (_GTK_'s) keymaps are
different, some special keys might be not recognized by XGngeo. If it
occurs, please tell us (see the "Help" chapter)!

Internationalization
====================

XGngeo, since version 10, is multilingual! At this time, translations
are available in these languages:

   * english (default)

   * french

   * polish

   * portuguese

   * spanish

   If you want to make a translation of XGngeo in your language, follow
these steps:

  1. Go to the `data/lang/' directory.

  2. Create a directory named as your language's code (returned with:
     `echo $LANG'). See
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_15.html#SEC221'
     for an exhaustive list.

  3. Into the last one, create a new directory named `LC_MESSAGES'.

  4. Go back to `data/lang/' then open the translation template
     `xgngeo.pot' with your favorite translation tool (KBabel,
     GTranslator, etc.).

  5. Once you've finished translating. Save it as
     `_XX_/LC_MESSAGES/xgngeo.po' (where _XX_ is your language's code).

  6. Go to `_XX_/LC_MESSAGES/' then do: `msgfmt xgngeo.po -o
     xgngeo.mo'. This will create a ".mo" file readable by the program.

  7. Launch XGngeo which is now translated in your language!

   Every time you update your translation, don't forget to repeat step
6. When it's Ok, send your ".po" file to: <choplair@fr.st>.

Help
****

   * If you get any problems using XGngeo (the problem may come from
     Gngeo), the best way is to ask for help in the Gngeo's mailling
     list:

        * SUSCRIBE: send a blank email to <gngeo-request@ml.free.fr>
          with the subject *subscribe*.

        * POSTING: send your messages to <gngeo@ml.free.fr>.

     Please give any details about the error that you can (version of
     Gngeo & XGngeo used, etc.).

   * Ortherwise, if you are sure that the problem is related to XGngeo,
     or you simply want to contact us, you should post a message on the
     Choplair-network's BBS: `http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/bbs/'.
