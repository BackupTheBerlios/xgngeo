@chapter Introduction
@strong{XGngeo} is a frontend (@acronym{GUI}) for @strong{Gngeo} which is a Neo Geo emulator for GNU/Linux. Both are free software released under the @emph{GNU GPL license}.
XGngeo is written in Python and uses the PyGTK library to provide a user-friendly interface!@*
XGngeo is developed by the @strong{Choplair-network}, lastest version/information should be available on our website: @uref{http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/}.
@sp 1
This documentation provides up to date informations and a @emph{Newbies Guide} about how to get started with XGngeo. It will grow (I hope...) with each new version.

@chapter Get started
This is the complete procedure about how to get XGngeo fully functional from scratch!

@section Gngeo
XGngeo is a frontend for Gngeo, so you need this one!@*
Download the last stable Gngeo package from @uref{http://m.peponas.free.fr/gngeo/}.
Unpack it, configure, then start compilation... If the compilation fails, take a look at the @sc{Help} chapter. Otherwise, you may now install it... 

@section Other requirements
In order to get XGngeo running, you need the following software installed on your computer:

@itemize @minus
@item The @strong{Python} programming language (version 2.2 or more) - @uref{http://www.python.org/};
@item The @strong{PyGTK} library (version 1.99 or more) - @uref{http://www.pygtk.org/}.
@end itemize

@section Neo Geo bios
To be able to launch roms, Gngeo needs a Neo Geo bios which have to be put (as unpackted format) in your Rom's directory.

@section Run XGngeo
It's time! Your are now ready to taste XGngeo. ^^@*
Download the last XGngeo package from the Choplair-network homepage: @uref{http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/}.@*
Unpack it then enter in the @file{xgngeo-@emph{XX}} directory (where @emph{XX} is XGngeo's version number).
XGngeo doesn't need any compilation phase. To launch it, simply type: @command{python xgngeo.py}.
If you get an error doing that, please see the @sc{Help} chapter.

@section Configuration
Because it's the first time you are using Gngeo, XGngeo invites you to set up the configuration.
Press @sc{Ok} then the configuration window appears... You can let default values if you are in a rush, the only params that you must define are @sc{Path to romrc} and @sc{Roms and bios directory}. Once you have finished, press @sc{Save}.@*
Of course the configuration can be modified at any time using the same configuration window.

@chapter Focus on...

@section Configuration files
XGngeo's configuration interface actually manages options of 2 configuration files in the same time. Both use the same syntax to set values at variables.

@subsection @file{gngeorc}
This is the Gngeo's configuration file, situated in the @file{~/gngeo/} directory. It lets you customize many params of the emulator (graphic, sound, etc.), some are very important (path to the @file{romrc} file, etc.).@*
If at startup XGngeo doesn't find the @file{gngeorc} file, it invites you to create it through its main configuration window.

@subsection @file{xgngeo.conf}
This is the XGngeo's own configuration file, situated in the @file{data/} directory which is in the XGngeo's. This second file is less important, there are only options related to XGngeo (size of history, preview images' directory, etc.).
That's why most of these options are in the @sc{Other} section of the main configuration window. 

@section Rom list add-ons
These are optional features which give you a comfortable selection while selecting any game in the Rom list. They can be configured in the @sc{Other} section of the main configuration window.

@subsection Preview images
XGngeo is able to display a preview image of any of the games selected in the list.@*
It is fully compatible with the preview images used by other frontends such @acronym{GGF}.@*
A preview images pack archive, which will have to be unpacked somewhere, can be easily obtained from Gngeo's or Choplair-network's homepage...

@subsection Rom infos
@acronym{GGF}'s developpers have created an @acronym{XML} file containing information for each Rom (description, manufacturer, year, etc.).@*
This is the perfect addition to preview images and it's fully supported by XGngeo! 

@section Keys configuration
XGngeo has a Keys configurator which is in a seperate window than the main configuration window. It works for the 2 players, but manages only keyboard.
To modify a key, click on the corresponding button then push your new key.
@sp 1
@sc{Warning:} because Gngeo (@acronym{SDL}'s) and XGngeo (@acronym{GTK}'s) keymaps are different, some special keys might be not recognized by XGngeo. If it occurs, please tell us (see the @sc{Help} chapter)!

@section Internationalization
XGngeo is multilingual! Translations are available in these languages:

@c ### Please keep an alphabetical order. ###
@itemize @minus
@item English (default)
@item French
@item Polish
@item Portuguese (of Brazil)
@item Spanish
@end itemize

@subsection New translation
If you want to make a translation of XGngeo in your language, follow these generic instructions:

@enumerate
@item Get the lastest CVS version by doing the following command: @* @w{@command{cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.xgngeo.berlios.de:/cvsroot/xgngeo checkout xgngeo}}
@item Go to the @file{lang/} directory which is in @file{xgngeo/data/}.
@item Create a directory named as your language's code (returned by @command{echo $LANG}). See @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_15.html#SEC221} for a exhaustive list.
@item Into this one, create a new directory named @file{LC_MESSAGES}.
@item Go back to the @file{lang/} directory then open the translation template @file{xgngeo.pot} with your favorite translation tool (KBabel, GTranslator, etc.).
@item Once you've finished translating. Save it as @file{@emph{XX}/LC_MESSAGES/xgngeo.po} (where @emph{XX} is your language's code).
@item Go to @file{@emph{XX}/LC_MESSAGES/} then do: @command{msgfmt xgngeo.po -o xgngeo.mo}. This will create a binary file (@file{xgngeo.mo}) readable by the program.
@item Launch XGngeo which is now translated in your language!
@end enumerate

Every time you update your translation, don't forget to repeat step number 7. When it's Ok, send your `.po' file to: @email{choplair[AT]fr.st}.

@chapter Help!

If you get any problems using XGngeo or Gngeo, the best way is to ask for help in the Gngeo's mailling list:

@itemize @minus
@item @sc{Suscribtion:} send a blank email with the subject @w{@strong{subscribe}} to @email{gngeo-request[AT]ml.free.fr}.
@item @sc{Posting:} send your messages to @email{gngeo[AT]ml.free.fr}.
