@chapter Introduction
@strong{XGngeo} is a frontend (@acronym{GUI}) for the Neo Geo emulator @strong{Gngeo}, both are free softwares released under the @emph{GNU GPL license}.
XGngeo is written in Python and uses the PyGTK library to provide an user-friendly interface!@*
XGngeo is developed by the @strong{Choplair-network}, last version/informations should be available on our website: @uref{http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/}.
@sp 1
This documentation provides up to date informations and a @emph{Newbies Guide} about get started with XGngeo. It will grow (I hope...) with each new version.

@chapter Get started
This is the complete procedure about how to get XGngeo fully functional from scratch!

@section Gngeo
XGngeo is a frontend for Gngeo, so you need this one!@*
Download the last stable Gngeo package from @uref{http://m.peponas.free.fr/gngeo/}.
Unpack it, configure, then start compilation... If the compilation fails, take a look at the "Help" chapter. Otherwise, you may now install it... 

@section Other requirements
In order to get XGngeo running, you need the following software installed on your computer:

@itemize @bullet
@item The @strong{Python} programming language (version 2.2 or more) - @uref{http://www.python.org/};
@item The @strong{PyGTK} library (version 1.99 or more) - @uref{http://www.daa.com.au/~james/software/pygtk/}.
@end itemize

@section Neo Geo bios
To be able to launch roms, Gngeo needs a Neo Geo bios which have to be put (as unpackted format) in your Rom's directory.

@section Run XGngeo
It's time! Your are now ready to taste XGngeo. ^^@*
Download the last XGngeo package from the Choplair-network homepage: @uref{http://choplair.tuxfamily.org/}.@*
Unpack it then enter in the @file{xgngeo-@emph{XX}} directory (where @emph{XX} is XGngeo's version number).
XGngeo doesn't need any compilation phase. To launch it, simply type: @command{python xgngeo.py}.
If you get an error doing that, please see the "Help" chapter.

@section Configuration
Because it's the first time you are using Gngeo, XGngeo invites you to set up the configuration.
Press @sc{Ok} then the configuration window appears... You can let defaut values if you are hurry, the only params that you must define are @sc{Path to romrc} and @sc{Roms and bios directory}. Once you have finished, press @sc{Save}. @*
Of course the configuration can be modified at any time using the same configuration window.

@chapter Focus on...

@section Preview images
This is an optional feature. XGngeo is able to display preview images while selecting any of the games in the list.@*
It is fully compatible with the preview images used by other frontends such @emph{GGF}.@*
To enable the preview images, simply get the images pack archive (which you may get from Gngeo's homepage or at the Choplair-network...) and unpack it... A directory should be created, specify this one in @sc{Config > Other > Preview images directory (optional)} then enjoy preview images!

@section Keys configuration
XGngeo got a Key Configurator which is in a seperate window than the main configuration window. It works for the 2 players, but only with keyboard.
To modify a key, click on the corresponding button then push your new key.
@sp 1
@strong{Warning:} Because Gngeo (@emph{SDL}'s) and XGngeo (@emph{GTK}'s) keymaps are different, some special keys might be not recognized by XGngeo. If it occurs, please tell us (see the "Help" chapter)!

@section Internationalization
XGngeo is multilingual! Translations are available in these languages:

@itemize @bullet
@item english (default)
@item french
@item polish
@item portuguese
@item spanish
@end itemize

If you want to make a translation of XGngeo in your language, follow these steps:

@enumerate
@item Get the lastest CVS version by doing the following:
@itemize
@item @command{cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.xgngeo.berlios.de:/cvsroot/xgngeo login} (press @key{RET})
@item @command{cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.xgngeo.berlios.de:/cvsroot/xgngeo xgngeo}
@end itemize
@item Go to the @file{data/lang/} directory.
@item Create a directory named as your language's code (returned with: @command{echo $LANG}). See @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_15.html#SEC221} for a exhaustive list.
@item Into the last one, create a new directory named @file{LC_MESSAGES}.
@item Go back to @file{data/lang/} then open the translation template @file{xgngeo.pot} with your favorite translation tool (KBabel, GTranslator, etc.).
@item Once you've finished translating. Save it as @file{@emph{XX}/LC_MESSAGES/xgngeo.po} (where @emph{XX} is your language's code).
@item Go to @file{@emph{XX}/LC_MESSAGES/} then do: @command{msgfmt xgngeo.po -o xgngeo.mo}. This will create a ".mo" file readable by the program.
@item Launch XGngeo which is now translated in your language!
@end enumerate

Every time you update your translation, don't forget to repeat step 7. When it's Ok, send your ".po" file to: @email{choplair[AT]fr.st}.

@chapter Help

If you get any problems using XGngeo or Gngeo, the best way is to ask for help in the Gngeo's mailling list:
