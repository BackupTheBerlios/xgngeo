 XGngeo - Changelog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changes in version 16 (2006-XX-XX):

- ROM list now supports multiple ROM directories (IN PROGRESS).
- New integrated ROM driver editor (IN PROGRESS).
- Added possibility to select the new Universal BIOS.
- Better guessing of the default path to Gngeo's `romrc' file.
- Added possibility to choose XGngeo window to be centered on
the screen on start.
- Bugfix: no more problem in the Rom list with some PyGTK ins-
tallations. 
- Added checking for the PyGTK version (must be 2.6 or more).
- Minimum accepted Gngeo version setted to 0.6.11 (current :p).
- System-wide installation (using distutil) & per-user XGngeo
configuration.
- New German translation by Peter Kainrad.

* Changes in version 15 (2005-07-14):

- Big configuration panels reorganization with now 3 different
windows: ``Important paths" (which contains the required
parameters that have to be valid for a correct emultation),
``Global emulation" (which contains Neo Geo default emulation
options for all Roms) and ``Other things" (which mostly
contains XGngeo-specific parameters).
- Improvements on the Rom list window which now features, for
the first time in a Gngeo frontend ever, the possibility to set
Rom-specific emulation options! ^___^";
- Added a new ``Joystick" section, merged with the ``Audio"
one, where you can, among others, modify the joystick devices
used by the two players.
- Improved key configurator which, among others, now displays
the key names in place of their SDL values.
- Use of the new GTK+ file chooser for selecting files and
directories.
- Added support for the bigger windowed screen size and the
Raster effect options.
- Now preventing effect in the list from being selected when
the ``YUV" blitter (which does not support effect) is choosed.
- Display of a sort of progress bar indicating that the Rom
is being started, and of warning messages that may return
Gngeo if it encounters a problem starting the game.
- If already on the ``History" menu, loaded Rom name isn't
repeated any more but moved to the first place. By the way,
this menu can now be torn off.
- Some options involving path now come along with little icons
which indicate whether the path is valid or not (yeah that's a
killer feature :p).
- Better handling of parameters in configurations files.
- Loads of GUI enhancements, and replacement of the GTK+
deprecated widgets.
- Added the possibility to set the absolute path of the Gngeo
executable. It may be interesting if the `gngeo' command
isn't in your `$PATH' or if you have several versions of Gngeo
installed.
- The fullname of a manually loaded Rom is now displayed in
the status bar too (if its MAME name is recognized).
- Rom list add-ons (Rom preview image or informations) can be
simply enabled/disabled using check boxes. :p
- Bugfix: no more problem with paths containing space or quote
characters.
- Bugfix: Gngeo wasn't killed when you want to quit XGngeo
while the emulator was running.
- Bugfix: XGngeo crashed if it didn't find Gngeo's global
configuration file.
- Rom history maximum size raised to 20.
- Widely enlarged documentation (with spelling corrections
powered by Hori the wonderul!), now quickly accessible through
the ``Infos" menu.
- Addition of a marvellous XGngeo icon. ^^;
