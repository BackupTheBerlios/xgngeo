 XGngeo - Changelog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changes in version 15 (2005-XX-XX):

- Configuration panels reorganization with now 3 different
windows: ``Important paths" (which contains the required
parameters that will have to be set if the Gngeo configuration
file isn't found), ``Global emulation" (which contains Neo Geo
default emulation options (Graphic, Audio, Keys...) and
``Other" (which mostly contains XGngeo-specific parameters).
- Improvements on the Rom list window which now features, for
the first time in a Gngeo frontend ever, possibility to set
emulation options specific to a Rom ! ^___^";
- Added a new ``Joystick" section, merged with the ``Audio"
one, where you can, among others, modify the joystick devices
used by the two players.
- Use of the new GTK+ file chooser for selecting files and
directories.
- Added support for the bigger windowed screen size and the
Raster effect options.
- Display of a sort of progress bar indicating that the Rom
is being started, and of warning messages that may return
Gngeo if it encounters a problem starting the game.
- If already on the ``History" menu, loaded Rom name isn't
repeated any more but moved to the first place.
- Paths in the Option panel now come along with little icons 
which indicate whether the path is valid or not (yeah that's
a killer feature :p).
- Many other GUI enhancements and replacement of the deprac-
tated widgets.
- Added the possibility to set the absolute path of the Gngeo
executable. It may be interesting if the `gngeo' command
isn't in your PATH or if you have several versions of Gngeo
installed.
- The fullname of a manually loaded Rom is now displayed in
the status bar too (if its MAME name is recognized).
- Bugfix: Gngeo wasn't killed when you want to quit XGngeo
while the emulator was running.
- Bugfix: XGngeo crashed if it didn't find gngeo's configura-
tion file.
